# DemoDask
Dask has utilities and documentation on how to deploy internally, in the cloud, or on HPC supercomputers. Supports encryption and authentication using TLS / SSL certificates. It's tough and can handle failure of worker nodes gracefully and it's springy so you can take advantage of new nodes added on the fly. Dask includes several user APIs that are used and refined by thousands of researchers around the world working in different domains.
